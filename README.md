This is a tool to analyze Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) data.
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence-lifetime_imaging_microscopy for
an introduction on the technique.


It supports Quadrant-Anode (QA) data, recorded using Europhoton's detector,
as well as PicoQuant's pt3 format. ASCII data can be read as well.


The fitting of the fluorescence lifetime is done using Poissonian Maximum-
Likelihood-Estimation (MLE) according to:
